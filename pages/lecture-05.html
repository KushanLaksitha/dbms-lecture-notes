        <div class="topic-description">
            <p>
                The Entity-Relationship (ER) model is a high-level conceptual data model used to visualize the structure of a database. Its core components are entities, attributes, and relationships.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Entity:</strong> An entity is a real-world object or concept that can be distinctly identified. For example, in a university database, entities could be a specific `Student`, a `Professor`, or a `Course`.</li>
                <li><strong>Entity Type (or Entity Set):</strong> This is a collection of entities that share the same properties or attributes. For example, `STUDENT` is an entity type that represents the set of all students in the university. In an ER diagram, an entity type is typically represented by a rectangle.</li>
                <li><strong>Attribute:</strong> An attribute is a property or characteristic of an entity type. For the `STUDENT` entity type, attributes could include `StudentID`, `Name`, `Address`, and `DateOfBirth`. Attributes are represented by ovals in an ER diagram.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="topic-section">
        <h2 class="topic-title">Relationship Types</h2>
        <div class="topic-description">
            <p>
                A <strong>relationship</strong> is an association among two or more entities. A <strong>relationship type</strong> defines a set of associations among entities from one or more entity types.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, an `ENROLLS_IN` relationship type could associate `STUDENT` entities with `COURSE` entities. A specific instance of this relationship would be 'Student John Smith enrolls in Course CS101'. In an ER diagram, a relationship type is represented by a diamond shape.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Degree of a Relationship:</strong> The number of participating entity types.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Unary (Recursive):</strong> A relationship between instances of the same entity type. (e.g., an `EMPLOYEE` supervises another `EMPLOYEE`).</li>
                    <li><strong>Binary:</strong> A relationship between two different entity types. This is the most common type. (e.g., `STUDENT` enrolls in `COURSE`).</li>
                    <li><strong>Ternary:</strong> A relationship involving three entity types. (e.g., a `DOCTOR` prescribes a `MEDICINE` for a `PATIENT`).</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="topic-section">
        <h2 class="topic-title">Cardinality and Participation</h2>
        <div class="topic-description">
            <p>
                These constraints define the rules of association between entities.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Cardinality Ratio</strong> specifies the maximum number of relationship instances that an entity can participate in.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>One-to-One (1:1):</strong> An entity in Set A can be associated with at most one entity in Set B, and vice versa. (e.g., a `DEPARTMENT` is managed by one `MANAGER`).</li>
                <li><strong>One-to-Many (1:N):</strong> An entity in Set A can be associated with many entities in Set B, but an entity in Set B can be associated with at most one entity in Set A. (e.g., a `PROFESSOR` teaches many `COURSES`).</li>
                <li><strong>Many-to-Many (M:N):</strong> An entity in Set A can be associated with many entities in Set B, and vice versa. (e.g., `STUDENTS` enroll in many `COURSES`).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Participation Constraint</strong> specifies whether the existence of an entity depends on its being related to another entity via the relationship type.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Total Participation (Mandatory):</strong> Every entity in the entity set must participate in at least one relationship instance. (e.g., every `COURSE` must be taught by a `PROFESSOR`). This is often shown with a double line in ER diagrams.</li>
                <li><strong>Partial Participation (Optional):</strong> Not all entities in the set need to participate in the relationship. (e.g., a `PROFESSOR` does not necessarily have to teach a `COURSE` every semester). This is shown with a single line.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

    <div class="topic-section">
        <h2 class="topic-title">Weak Entities</h2>
        <div class="topic-description">
            <p>
                A <strong>weak entity type</strong> is an entity type that does not have a key attribute of its own. It cannot be uniquely identified by its attributes alone. Its existence is dependent on another entity type, called the <strong>strong (or identifying) entity type</strong>.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Identifying Relationship:</strong> The relationship that associates a weak entity type with its strong entity type.</li>
                <li><strong>Partial Key (or Discriminator):</strong> An attribute or set of attributes of a weak entity that, combined with the primary key of the strong entity, uniquely identifies a weak entity instance.</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> Consider an `EMPLOYEE` and their `DEPENDENT`. `DEPENDENT` is a weak entity because a dependent cannot exist without the employee, and their `Name` might not be unique across all dependents. The `Name` is a partial key. To uniquely identify a dependent, you need the `EmployeeID` from the `EMPLOYEE` entity and the `Name` of the dependent.</li>
                <li>In ER diagrams, weak entity types and their identifying relationships are typically shown with double-lined rectangles and diamonds, respectively.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="topic-section">
        <h2 class="topic-title">Interactive ER Tool</h2>
        <div class="topic-description">
            <p>
                An <strong>interactive ER tool</strong> is a software application that allows database designers to create and manipulate Entity-Relationship diagrams visually. These tools provide a graphical user interface where you can drag and drop symbols for entities, relationships, and attributes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using such a tool simplifies the database design process significantly. Key features often include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A palette of ER diagram notations (rectangles, diamonds, ovals).</li>
                <li>The ability to connect shapes to define relationships and link attributes.</li>
                <li>Options to specify constraints like cardinality and participation.</li>
                <li>Automated validation to check for design errors.</li>
                <li>The ability to automatically generate SQL DDL code from the finished diagram, which can be used to create the actual database tables.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Popular examples of ER diagramming tools include Lucidchart, draw.io, and MySQL Workbench.</p>
