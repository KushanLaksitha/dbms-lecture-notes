        <h2 class="topic-title">Introduction to Data Models</h2>
        <div class="topic-description">
            <p>
                A <strong>data model</strong> is a conceptual framework that defines the logical structure of a database. It provides a way to describe the design of a database at the logical level, including the data elements, the relationships between them, and the constraints that apply. Data models are essential as they form the foundation upon which a database is built, ensuring consistency and structure.

    <div class="topic-section">
        <h2 class="topic-title">Hierarchical Data Model</h2>
        <div class="topic-description">
            <p>
                This is one of the earliest data models, originating in the 1960s. The <strong>hierarchical model</strong> organizes data in a tree-like structure. Data is stored as records which are connected to one another through links. Each record has a single parent, but can have multiple children. The top-level record is called the "root."
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Structure:</strong> A strict parent-child hierarchy (one-to-many relationship).</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> An organizational chart where a manager (parent) has several employees (children).</li>
                <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Simple to understand, fast for accessing data along the hierarchical paths, and promotes data integrity since a child cannot exist without a parent.</li>
                <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Inflexible, as it cannot easily represent many-to-many relationships. Data retrieval can be inefficient if it doesn't follow the hierarchical path.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="topic-section">
        <h2 class="topic-title">Network Data Model</h2>
        <div class="topic-description">
            <p>
                The <strong>network model</strong> was developed to address the limitations of the hierarchical model. It also organizes data using records and links, but it allows a child record to have multiple parent records. This creates a more flexible graph-like structure instead of a strict tree.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Structure:</strong> A graph or lattice structure, allowing for many-to-many relationships.</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> In a university database, a `Student` record could be linked to multiple `Course` records, and a `Course` record could be linked to multiple `Student` records.</li>
                <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> More flexible than the hierarchical model, capable of handling complex relationships, and reduces data redundancy.</li>
                <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Can become very complex to design and maintain. Navigating the database requires programmers to be familiar with the physical data structure.</li>

    <div class="topic-section">
        <h2 class="topic-title">Relational Data Model</h2>
        <div class="topic-description">
            <p>
                Proposed by E.F. Codd in 1970, the <strong>relational model</strong> is the most widely used data model today. It organizes data into two-dimensional tables, also known as <strong>relations</strong>. Each table consists of rows (tuples) and columns (attributes).
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Data is stored in tables. Relationships between tables are established through common columns using primary and foreign keys.</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> An `Employees` table and a `Departments` table, linked by a `DepartmentID` column present in both.</li>
                <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Highly flexible and easy to understand. It provides structural independence, meaning the data structure can be changed without affecting how data is accessed. SQL provides a powerful and standardized way to interact with the data.</li>
                <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Can sometimes lead to performance issues with very large and complex queries that require joining many tables.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="topic-section">
        <h2 class="topic-title">Object-Oriented Data Model</h2>
        <div class="topic-description">
            <p>
                The <strong>object-oriented data model</strong> stores data in the form of objects, which are instances of classes. This model emerged to handle the complex data types required by applications written in object-oriented programming languages like Java or C++. An object encapsulates both data (attributes) and behavior (methods).
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Data and its associated operations are stored together as objects. It supports features like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> A `Car` object could have attributes like `color` and `model`, and methods like `startEngine()` and `accelerate()`.</li>
                <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Can handle complex and diverse data types (e.g., images, audio). It reduces the "impedance mismatch" between the application's object model and the database's relational model.</li>
                <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Can be more complex than the relational model and has a less standardized query language compared to SQL. The market for OODBMS is smaller than for RDBMS.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2 class="topic-title">The Relational Model in Practice: MySQL</h2>
        <div class="topic-description">
            <p>
                MySQL is a popular open-source <strong>Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)</strong>. It is a specific software implementation of the relational data model. In MySQL, the logical structure is defined by creating tables with specific columns, and each column is assigned a data type.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>MySQL data types</strong> define what kind of value a column can hold. Choosing the correct data type is crucial for data integrity and performance. Common data types in MySQL include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Numeric Types:</strong> `INT` (integers), `DECIMAL` (fixed-point numbers), `FLOAT` (floating-point numbers).</li>
                <li><strong>String Types:</strong> `VARCHAR(n)` (variable-length strings up to n characters), `TEXT` (long text data), `CHAR(n)` (fixed-length strings).</li>
                <li><strong>Date and Time Types:</strong> `DATE` (stores 'YYYY-MM-DD'), `TIME` (stores 'HH:MI:SS'), `DATETIME` (stores both date and time), `TIMESTAMP` (stores a point in time, useful for tracking changes).</li>
            </ul>
